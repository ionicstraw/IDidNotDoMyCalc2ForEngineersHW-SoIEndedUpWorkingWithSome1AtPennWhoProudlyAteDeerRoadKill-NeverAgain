# IDidNotDoMyCalc2ForEngineersHW-SoIEndedUpWorkingWithSome1AtPennWhoProudlyAteDeerRoadKill-NeverAgain

im doing all of my hw, learned the hard way, i never want to be around weirdos and absolute freaks ever again

the best part of that class was it didnt matter how u did on the first 3 exams, if u could do better on the final exam, that would be ur final grade but the curve was always so high. a lot of ppl have difficulty with that class, it was set up as a filter, i dunno its easier to learn math now bc of youtube etc but in order to pass the final, i had to sit for 3 weeks studying for that class and i did it, so i learned i could do that

why didnt i do my calc2 for engineers hw, uhhhh bc i didnt think i could do it, my relationship with math was that i didnt think i could do it, i didnt think i needed it and i didnt know how to study for math quizzes/tests like at all, i was just on my own i had to figure it out on my own. then i liked it
